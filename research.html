                    </p>

                        <b>Abstract: </b>COVID-19 disproportionately affects the low-wage workers whose spatiotemporal mobility pattens, e.g., between housing and job, have dramatically changed. Microtransit service has been recently launched in Detroit
                        to complement the existing public transit options. Despite the initial success, a salient issue is how to effectively and efficiently utilize microtransit resources to ameliorate spatiotemporal mismatch between employment and housing
                        for low-wage workers. With the rise of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and increasingly available smart mobility data, the vision of this research project is to create a dynamic routing prediction system based on learning the hourly
                        mobility patterns between jobs and housing. It is designed for the stakeholders (i.e., community advocates and public transport authority) to visualize and forecast the mismatch between employment and housing, which is translated
                        into a dynamic trip demand that can be used to design adaptive routing algorithms to optimize the allocation of microtransit resources and to enhance micromobility via minimizing the rider?s first/last mile.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Currently public transportation with fixed routes and schedules are periodically tweaked and/or augmented to ameliorate the ever-changing spatial mismatch. Despite its long-term effectiveness, it is not sufficiently flexible to adapt to the hourly spatiotemporal
                        variation of jobs-housing mobility patterns primarily from the hourly paid workers. The long-term goal of this project is to work with civic partners in the city of Detroit to (1) design, implement and deploy an AI-assist microtransit
                        system to ameliorate the spatiotemporal mismatch between housing and employment, particularly for the low-wage workers residing in the under resourced neighborhoods; and (2) use geocoded socioeconomic data to identify the community
                        with disparities in mobility and deploy smart mobility technology to reduce the disparities and foster thriving communities. The project?s near-term objective is to leverage and power the existing microtransit service with cutting-edge
                        technology and select a few spatiotemporally mismatched regions in Detroit as the testbed for our smart mobility strategy.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The research innovation is expected to provide immediate, low-cost yet effective public transit solutions that are expected to bring an immediate benefit to the vulnerable communities in Detroit by significantly reducing transit risk, commute time/distance
                        and trip cost. It can be replicated to other US cities to ameliorate the spatiotemporal mismatch between housing and employment. In addition, it can provide insight for designing long-term intervention strategies to eliminate the
                        mismatch and reduce the mobility disparities, for example, government to launch new transportation options and create jobs; and builders to develop housing in the mismatched regions.

                        <p>
                            <b>Abstract: </b>Since the first COVID-19 case was diagnosed and reported at the end of December 2019, there have been more than 1.6 million COVID-19 cases reported, causing more than 100,000 death worldwide as of April 10,
                            2020. The outbreak of COVID-19 has significantly affected individuals and our society as a whole, and many national and international events have been canceled over COVID-19 fears, including NBA, NCAA events, Mobile World Congress.
                            For the sake of either individual, institutes, or governments, a risk prediction and update system are urgently needed. However, to design and implement such a system, there are several system challenges. First, how to derive
                            the infection risk level from different granularities, i.e., individual-, event-, and institution-levels? Second, how to dynamically update the risk level based on the latest outbreak news? Third, how to preserve user sensitive
                            data while sharing adequate data for risk level calculation? To attack these challenges in this RAPID project, researchers at Wayne State University and Henry Ford Health Systems design and implement CORPUS, an edge intelligence-assisted,
                            multi-granularity COVID-19 Risk Prediction, and Update System, which includes a mobile app running on personal phones, as well as a large-scale distributed protocol behind the app collecting and updating the information. First,
                            CORPUS will build a multi-granularity risk analysis model, from fine-grained personal risk to small clustered meeting risk, to coarse-grained large clustered event risk, and institutional/organization risk. Second, CORPUS employs
                            a data propagation protocol to build and update the risk analysis model. The data that can contribute to CORPUS include spatial data (such as GPS signal), temporal data (such as calendar event), as well as the input from the
                            user (such as meeting with a specific person). Third, CORPUS leverages privacy-preserving algorithms such as node-level feature pooling and anonymous parameter of the model instead of raw user data, to ensure the confidentiality
                            of personal information when multi-granularity models request personal risk information.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            With the rapid expansion of COVID-19, there is an urgent need for the individual to know their infection risk when traveling to a place in the foreseeable future. CORPUS can meet their needs by leveraging personalized information and edge intelligence.
                            For a group or an organization, CORPUS will provide risk-related information to help them to judge the feasibility of holding a meeting or an event during an outbreak, especially for large-scale international events (such as
                            the Olympics and World Cup). They can also proactively take action based on the risk information provided by CORPUS to reduce the spread of COVID-19. CORPUS will help governments perceive the risk of infection in their jurisdictions,
                            and thus guide infection prevention and control for effective governance.

                        <b>Abstract: </b>Children have been disproportionately less impacted by the Corona Virus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Corona Virus 2 (SAR-CoV-2) compared to adults. However, severe illnesses
                        including Multisystem Inflammatory Syndrome (MIS-C) and respiratory failure have occurred in a small proportion of children with SARS-CoV-2 infection. Nearly 80% of children with MIS-C are critically ill with a 2-4% mortality rate.
                        Currently there are no modalities to characterize the spectrum of disease severity and predict which child with SARS-CoV-2 exposure will likely develop severe illness including MIS-C. Thus there is an urgent need to develop a diagnostic
                        modality to distinguish the varying phenotypes of disease and risk stratify disease. The epigenetic changes in microRNA (miRNA) profiles that occur due to an infection can impact disease severity by altering immune response and
                        cytokine regulation which may be detected in body fluids including saliva. Our long-term goal is to improve outcomes of children with SARS-CoV-2 by early identification and treatment of those at risk for severe illness. Our central
                        hypothesis is that a model that integrates salivary biomarkers with social and clinical determinants of health will predict disease severity in children with SARS-CoV-2 infection. The central hypothesis will be pursued through
                        phased four specific aims. The first two aims will be pursued during the R61 phase and include: 1) Define and compare the salivary molecular host response in children with varying phenotypes (severe and non severe) SARS-CoV-2 infections
                        and 2) Develop and validate a sensitive and specific model to predict severe SARS-CoV-2 illness in children. During the R33 phase we will pursue the following two aims: 3) Develop a portable, rapid device that quantifies salivary
                        miRNAs with comparable accuracy to predicate technology (qRT-PCR), and 4) Develop an artificial intelligence (AI) assisted cloud and mobile system for early recognition of severe SARS-CoV-2 infection in children. We will pursue
                        the above aims using an innovative combination of salivaomics and bioinformatics, analytic techniques of AI and clinical informatics. The proposed research is significant because development of a sensitive model to risk stratify
                        disease is expected to improve outcomes of children with severe SARS-CoV-2 infection via early recognition and timely intervention. The proximate expected outcome of this proposal is better understanding of the epigenetic regulation
                        of host immune response to the viral infection which we expect to lead to personalized therapy in the future. The results will have a positive impact immediately as it will lead to the creation of patient profiles based on individual
                        risk factors which can enable early identification of severe disease and appropriate resource allocation during the pandemic.

                            <b>Investigators: </b>Suzan Arslanturk

                            <b>Abstract: </b>Patients suffering from the same cancer disease often not only experience a high degree of symptomatic variability but also respond significantly different to the same treatment. As a result, many cancers are
                            over-diagnosed causing patients to receive unnecessary and costly cancer treatments, while some patients do not receive the needed treatment. These can be greatly reduced with targeted treatments that result in greater efficacy
                            and fewer debilitating or dose limiting side effects. Hence, the discovery of patient subgroups and/or disease subtypes that differ in cancer progression will help better tailor treatments with reduced lethality and improve
                            the quality of life by avoiding over-treatment. Studies have shown that, in addition to the genetic factors, such factors as clinical history, hormonal exposure, lifestyle, and epidemiologic factors may play an important role
                            in the onset and progression of cancers. Hence, investigation of clinically relevant disease subtypes cannot be achieved by solely analyzing data from a single source, i.e. only the genetic composition. This project will build
                            innovative machine learning technologies to integrate knowledge collected from multiple repositories from different cohorts of multiple data types (e.g. genomic, clinical, and epidemiologic) for a more accurate and robust discovery
                            of disease subgroups and/or patient subtypes. Its activities will thus advance the field of multi-type data integration from disparate sources with different cohorts. Anticipated results will greatly benefit the society by
                            reducing the health care costs and improving patient care by distinguishing between patients who are at higher-risk and need the most aggressive treatments from those who will never progress, recur, or develop resistance to
                            treatments. The interdisciplinary nature of the project will further the education of undergraduate and graduate students through cross-disciplinary training by bridging the fields of computer science, biology, and engineering.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            To meet these goals, the project will investigate a novel clinically-relevant disease subtyping system by flexibly integrating collective information available through multiple studies with different cohorts and heterogeneous data types using innovative
                            deep learning models and algorithms. Here, the investigator hypothesizes that if the information in partially coupled data from disparate sources is integrated in a meaningful way that is statistically sound and robust, then
                            the analysis on the integrated data would lead to a more unified picture and global view of the system, and thus, to a more accurate and robust discovery of disease subtypes. Existing data fusion approaches suffer from such
                            challenges as uniqueness, interpretability, high-dimensionality of the feature space and linearity assumptions. This project will develop theory, algorithms, and implementation of a deep machine learning technique capable of
                            discovering the salient knowledge of the learning task during the integration of disparate datasets. Therefore, it is expected to overcome such challenges as high dimensionality of genomic datasets. The project would result
                            in a valuable tool with broad implications and utility in cancer research. These findings will not only provide useful and valuable models to identify patient subgroups and/or disease subtypes, but will also result in a valuable
                            precision medicine resource for the wider scientific community on other diseases.
