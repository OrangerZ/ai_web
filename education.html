                                set of requirements other than those can be fulfilled using the off-the-shelf techniques. At the same time, it looks like not enough people are taking rigorous AI courses for this line of work.

                                and computing infrastructures to enable breakthrough in the wide adoption of AI techniques.

                            The mission of the M.S. program at the Department of Computer Science at Wayne State University is to instill in our students a strong theoretical background in computer science, to expose them to the various rich disciplines in computer science, and
                            to develop an appreciation for state of the art research. Students build their theoretical background via our core courses of algorithms and automata. Furthermore, students are able to broaden their perspectives by choosing
                            courses from a variety of computer science disciplines including artificial intelligence, bioinformatics, computer game design, computer graphics, computer networking, computer vision, data mining, database management systems,
                            parallel and distributed systems, real-time and embedded systems, and software engineering. Finally, our graduate seminars invite experts from across the country giving our students a taste for state of the art research. By
                            the end of our program, our students are well equipped and able to pursue further Ph.D. studies as well as careers in industry, government and other organizations. No changes are being made to the program mission statement
                            in the proposed program revisions.

                                The strong demand for high-level Autonomous Driving talent from market. Growth in the autonomous vehicle sector has been massive between 2015 and 2019: During this period, job postings increased by 833%, and job searches increased by 450%. At the same
                                time, it looks like not enough people are taking rigorous autonomous driving related courses for this line of work.

                                Although there are several master programs in autonomous systems already, most of them are multi-disciplinary with an emphasis on autonomous robotics using traditional electronic and mechanical techniques. Consequently, a few of them give students a comprehensive
                                understanding of state-of-the-art engineering practices used in the autonomous vehicle industry and let students get to interact with real data sets from a practical autonomous driving system.

                                Addition of the depth requirement to the breath requirement are expected to encourage computer science graduate students to focus more on autonomous driving related courses, honing their autonomous driving related technical skills and enhancing their
                                competition in the job market.
